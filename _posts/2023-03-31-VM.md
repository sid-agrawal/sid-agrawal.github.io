We think of virtual machines as an abstraction of the underlying hardware.
But I claim that this is far from the truth.


## What can a CPU do?
A CPU is meant to execute the user's code, and any time it spends running Operating System(OS),
or Hypervisor(HV) code is a waste of time.
But there are some instructions we only want the OS/HV to execute, and we call them privileged instructions.
The CPU can execute these privileged instructions only when the CPU is in a higher privileged mode.

In a simplistic view of a CPU, there are only two modes, viz. user and kernel.
Some instructions can be executed only in kernel mode and some in both user and kernel mode.

In a more complete view, there are three modes viz. user, kernel and hypervisor.
The relationship is better described by the diagram below.

## What does an OS do?
One of the jobs of the OS is to intercept instructions that
the user-program is not supposed to execute.

And similarly for the hypervisor.

## What about the application?
Let's look at how things look from the point of view of the
application running directly on the OS(on baremetal) or inside a VM.

**Normal Case**: Every time the user application generates a fault, the OS is invoked.
The OS does what action it needs to take and then delegates the the control back to the process.
The `action` can be update some state the OS is maintaining for the process, or just kill it.

**VM Case**: Now when a user application generates a fault, `conceptually` the control is given to the guest OS.
But in practise, the hardware still delegates control to the hostOS(aka Hypervisor), the hypervisor then determines
that this instruction is from a process inside a guestOS and then relay that information to the guestOS along
with information about the fault(type and PC at the least). The guestOS then does the same things as above.

<Talk about the state maintainted>


## Where do Virtualization Acceleration fit into all this?
With any virtualization assitance from the hardware every fault generated by the guest process is trapped to the
hostOS. But with virtualization accelerators (like VT-X), we can program to directly trap some of the faults to the
guestOS and thus bypassing the hostOS.



## Thinking of in terms of independent protection domains.
In the **Normal Case**, the OS and the process running on it are two separate protection domains. <define PD>.
All faults of the process are related to the OS.


In the **Virtualization Case**, the hostOS, the guestOS and the processG(inside the guest) are three separate PDs.
All faults from the guestOS are relayed to the hostOS, and all the faults from the processG are related to the guestOS.
