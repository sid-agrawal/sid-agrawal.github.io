In this article, I share the experience of getting to a point where we could run
userspace applications in seL4 which had CHERI capabilities enabled(Hybrid mode).
CHERI [6] is an architectural extension that adds HW capabilities to modern processors.
Morello [7] is the ARM implementation of CHERI.
SeL4 [8] is a formally verified microkernel widely deployed in security-critical applications.
Since seL4 is formally verified, it might not benefit from CHERI capabilities, 
but the user application running on seL4 will still benefit.

The model CheriBSD [9] provides for implementing an operating system on CHERI is not well matched to seL4, 
as CheriBSD is a monolithic kernel and seL4 is a monolithic kernel. 
In particular, CheriBSD's monolithic architecture does not require passing 
capabilities between processes, 
while seL4's microkernel architecture makes passing capabilities a hard requirement.

We designed a three-stage effort to port seL4 to Morello.
1. [X ] Run a hybrid userspace application. We do this because it
requires minimal change to the userspace, 
but it still requires kernel changes.
2. [ ] Run a purecap userspace application which will require porting of the userspace libraries.
3. [ ] Explore the mapping of CHERI caps to seL4 caps. 
We decided that this was not the right thing to do.

To date, we have completed the first stage. 
We successfully use CHERI capabilities within the seL4 userspace and 
identify challenges that must be met to complete Stages 2 and 3.


# BACKGROUND

This work lies at the intersection of capability-based microkernels and capability in hardware. 
In this section, we describe seL4 – a capability-based microkernel, 
and CHERI – a hardware platform with capability-enabled instructions.

## seL4
SeL4 is a formally verified capability-based microkernel. 
In a microkernel, most functionality provided by a typical monolithic kernel is provided by user-space servers. In a capability-based system, access to system resources is granted by unforgeable tokens called capabilities.

## CHERI

CHERI (Capability Hardware Enabled RISC Instruction)
is a hardware instruction set extension that provides hardware capabilities.
CHERI capabilities are 128 bits in size. 
They contain a virtual address, size of the accessible region, 
and permission with which that region can be accessed. 
CHERI protects its pointers, by enforcing three properties -– provenance, integrity, and monotonicity.
* **Provenance** means that capabilities can only be derived from other
valid capabilities and cannot be forged from an address.
* **Integrity** means that capabilities stored in memory cannot be modified. 
This is achieved by using tagged memory.
* **Monotonicity** requires that, when a capability is stored in a register, 
it is only possible to reduce its bounds and permissions, 
e.g., a read-only capability cannot be turned into a read-write one.

| Sealed Capabilities: CHERI capabilities have a sealed bit in the 128 bits. 
When this bit is set, the capability can be neither sealed nor changed. 
<!-- [Further describe how sealing and unsealing is done] -->

# EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS

Our port of seL4 to Morello proceeded in three stages. Next,
we describe the three stages, and the lesson learned in each stage.
## Hybrid Userspace

Hybrid userspace does not need changes in user applications 
but still requires changes in the kernel.
Regardless of the mode of compilation of the application,
the operating system must be changed to ensure that the new
registers are saved. 
Also, memory must be configured so that it
does not cause failure in capability loads and stores. 
More details are presented in the appendix.
CheriBSD is an adequate guide for this.

## Purecap Userspace

To take advantage of the spatial memory safety provided by
CHERI's end goal is to compile the application in Purecap mode.
In purecap mode, every pointer is a CHERI capability so 
the application gets the benefits of high-level languages like Rust/Python
with the performance of C/C++.
Unlike the hybrid mode, CheriBSD did not provide an adequate reference for the seL4 port. 
CheriBSD allows the kernel to pass capabilities to the user space and vice versa via a system call. 
However, since passing pointers via IPC is not essential to the
operation of a monolithic kernel, CheriBSD does not support it.
It is also not a good idea for two user processes to exchange 
CHERI capabilities with the mediation from the kernel.
Since CHERI capabilities are just virtual addresses and not tied to a
particular address space, this would mean that two colluding pro-
cesses could grow the range of virtual addresses they have access to.
IPC is necessary in a microkernel, as most of the system
call like features are implemented in user processes. See Figure 1

|![Purecap: Pointers are CHERI Caps](https://sid-agrawal.ca/images/fig-1_purecap-1.png) |![New Endpoint Permissions](https://sid-agrawal.ca/images/fig-2_new-endpoint-perms.png)|

So, we plan to extend the IPC mechanism in seL4. We
will add new permissions to the endpoint capability in seL4 to
allow/prevent sharing of CHERI capabilities via IPC. See Figure 2
and Figure 3.

Sealed capabilities are CHERI capabilities that cannot be
dereferenced. A CHERI capability (say, a pointer to an array) can be
sealed with another CHERI capability (called a sealing capability).
Once sealed, the capability to the array cannot be deferenced unless
it is unsealed by the original sealing capability.
CheriBSD splits its sealing cap range into only two ranges,
since there is only a user and a kernel. 
But in an uKernel system,
we have the kernel, system services, and user applications, so we
need to split the sealed caps into at least three ranges. Figure 4
When the CPU boots up, a root capability is put in a
well-known register. 
This root capability has access to the entire
virtual address range with all permissions.
CheriBSD keeps this root capability in the kernel and
gives a limited capability to the userspace. But we give the root
CHERI cap to root-task to mimic what seL4 does with seL4 caps.
<!-- [Sid:I feel like this is the right thing to do, but I do not have a good
reason].  -->
In seL4, the root-task gets the capabilities to any memory
not used by the kernel. The kernel does not make any caps to the
memory it uses during boot. 
Therefore, the root task has all the
available seL4 capabilities in the system. In that spirit, we hand
over the root CHERI capability to the root-task.

Capabilities in seL4 are tokens for calling methods on system
objects. They are implemented in the kernel using the system call
mechanism.
Revocation is an important feature of the seL4 capability
model, and the kernel maintains aCavailabilityDerivationTree
(CDT) to assist in revocation.
CHERI capabilities do not maintain a derivation tree. For
example, two capabilities for the same array are independent, and
there is no single palace to revoke it, short of scanning the entire
memory range.
We summarize these differences in Table 1.

Protection Domain All Caps in accessible memory All caps in the CSpace
we are heading towards a SASOS, would it still be seL4 after the
changes.
<!-- Discuss how Propagation, Restriction, Recovation .. works in both] -->
Due to these fundamental differences, the CHERI capabilities are
not a drop in replacement for the seL4 capabilities.


Example of parts of the seL4 capability system that can
be augmented with CHERI capabilities.

- Sealed Capabilities instead of the C-slot identifiers.
- Using Sealed Capabilities for control-flow transfer from kernel to userspace. 

Though we can implement parts of the seL4 capability
model using the CHERI instructions. It is unclear whether:
1. There will be an performance improvements
2. Would that make seL4 a Single Address Space OS(SASOS)?





# Closing remarks

This work enables C/C++ user applications on seL4 to use CHERI
features and get additional security guarantees. We also looked at
using CHERI capabilities as a replacement for seL4 capabilities and
concluded that they are fundamentally different. 
Our work provides a valuable contribution to the growing body of work on porting
systems software to the CHERI processor, which provides security
guarantees.

## Performance

Since we have done QEMU development work, which is not
cycle accurate, we did not collect performance numbers. Instead,
we calculate the number of extra instructions required for each
operation and the extra memory usage due to larger registers.

## Developer Effort

So far, we have spent approximately four months of full-time development effort between two developers. 
We spent most of the initial time understanding the details of seL4 boot-up, context-switch, and
process startup code. 
Similarly, time was spent understanding the
intricacies of the CHERI capabilities and setting up the toolchain to
compile seL4 with CHERI. 
So far, we have modified about 500 lines of code. 
For context, the kernel is about 10K LoC and the userspace
is 50K LoC. About 30% of the LoC are in the ARM assembly, and the rest are in C.

## Impact on Formal Verification

We added our changes to the `aarch64` platform-specific code of
seL4, invalidating the formal verification of seL4. 
We have tried to keep the changes in the kernel to the most essential.
But do not have a good sense of how much effort is needed to reverify the kernel.
